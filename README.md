# Energy-Harvesting-Backpack
An Efficient Design of an Energy Harvesting Backpack for Remote Applications

This respository contains the CAD model of designed backpack in this paper (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seta.2022.102173). We have used genetic algortihm to find the optimized model parameters. Moreover, dynamic model of the backpack was developed with simscape library in simulink. To verify the simscape model, we have derived and solved the differential equations of the model in MATLAB with ODE45 solver.

Here is the pictura of the backpack model
